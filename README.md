## Documentation
The application reads a text file, counts the unique items, creates a histogram .dat file, and lets users lookup items and their stats.

This application reads a file  that contains names of items that were recently sold. The program first reads the input file and creates a .dat file that lists the unique items and their occurrences. The menu option allows the user to print a histogram, look an item by name, or print a list of all items and their count in an inventory style list.
